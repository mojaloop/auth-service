          in non-hub hosted scenarios to notify participants of a consent being revoked.

          Called by a `auth-service` to notify a PISP and DFSP of consent status in hub hosted scenario.

        The **DELETE /consents/**_{ID}_ request is used to request the
        revocation of a previously agreed consent.

        For tracing and auditing purposes, the switch should be sure not to
        delete the consent physically;

        instead, information relating to the consent should be marked as deleted
        and requests relating to the

        consent should not be honoured.

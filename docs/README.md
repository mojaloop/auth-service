### BDD

[jest-cucumber](https://github.com/bencompton/jest-cucumber) allows to use `jest` to execute Gherkin scenarios. Thanks to `jest` we are getting also code coverage for BDD Scenarios.

in `test/features` are Feature/Scenarios in `.feature` files which contain declarations in Gherkin language.

in `test/step-definitions` are Steps implementations in `.step.ts` files.

Execute scenarios and report code coverage:
```bash
npm run test:bdd
```

### unit testing

`Jest` setup, which allows to prepare unit tests specified in `test/**/*.(spec|test).ts` files. Coverage report is always generated. If the speed of unit tests will go very slow we will refactor configuration to generate coverage only on demand.

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

If you want to generate test report in `junit` format do:
```bash
npm run test:junit
```

There is `mojaloop` convention to use `test/unit` path to keep tests. The placement of test folder should be similar to placement of tested code in `src` folder

### linting

[eslint]() setup compatible with javascript [standard](https://standardjs.com/) and dedicated for TypeScript [typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint).
  - it is much more flexible
  - has good support for editors to visualize linting problem during typing.

To lint all files simply run
```bash
npm run lint
```

### linting & auto fixing via pre-commit `husky` hook
Committing untested and bad formatted code to repo is bad behavior, so we use [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) integrated with [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged). 

There is defined `pre-commit` hook which runs linting only for staged files, so execution time is as fast as possible - only staged files are linted and if possible automatically fixed.

Corresponding excerpt from package.json:

```json
 "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged && npm run test:unit",
      "post-commit": "git update-index --again"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,ts}": "eslint --cache --fix"
  }
```
